	FiniteDifferenceExamples

		This is a collection of all finite difference code I found online when I was trying to program my own Finite Difference.

	FiniteVolume

		This is a collection of my own finite volume code which never worked correctly.

	FiniteVolumeExample

		This is a collection of finite volume code I was testing to understand finite volume.

	html

		This is the collection of all my MATLAB html documents for FiniteDifference.m and FiniteDifference2D.m
	
	OldFiniteDifference

		This was a collection of my own finite difference code before I decided to reformat it for better documentation and broke up the code into functions for more modularity.
	
	Reports

		Collection of reports for CMSE 802

	Tests

		Collection of my attempted unit tests in MATLAB which are not working yet.	

Good Example Programs to Run

	FiniteDifference.m

	FiniteDifference2D.m

**NOTE: both will interact with prompt questions that will interact with the user. It is recommended to answer the prompt with 0.75. Valid answers for the CFL prompt will be less than or equal to 1.
